This SSGSS Vegeta is aimed to be semi accurate to his EB gameplay. He can not fly or go to the 2nd plane of fighting.

X : Punch

Almost all moves link into the auto combo (X and Y) using different variations leads to different combos.

After certain combos (anything that knocks your opponent away) Pressing Z will follow up with a special.

Down, Forward, Z - Final Flash (Ground, Big Bang Ray (Air)
Back, Forward, Z - Big Bang Attack (Ground)

Doing the specials alone will cost 2000 Power (BBA costs 500 POWER)
Doing a combo first then a launcher then pressing Z will do the same super but at the cost of 1 bar.
