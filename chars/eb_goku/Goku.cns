IntPersistIndex = 58	;Variables with this index and above will not have their values
FloatPersistIndex = 40  ;reset to 0 between rounds or matches. There are 60 int variables,
  				;indexed from 0 to 59, and 40 float variables, indexed from 0 to 39.
  				;If omitted, then it defaults to 60 and 40 for integer and float
  				;variables repectively, meaning that none are persistent, i.e. all
  				;are reset. If you want your variables to persist between matches,
  				;you need to override state 5900 from common1.cns.
